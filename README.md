This project focuses on leveraging Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches to significantly improve the accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis. Through the application of Deep Learning techniques, we have achieved a remarkable accuracy rate of 95% and simultaneously enhanced the speed of the diagnosis process. This project contributes to better patient outcomes by providing a more reliable and efficient diagnostic tool for pneumonia.
